        <h1>Using STEM to Protect the Environment</h1>
        <p>Environmental challenges like climate change,
             pollution, and habitat loss affect every corner of our 
             planet.<br> To address these urgent issues, we need 
             solutions that come from a combination of scientific 
             understanding, technological innovation, engineering 
             ingenuity, and mathematical analysis.<br>Together, these 
             fields make up STEM, which is a powerful toolset we can use 
             to protect and preserve our environment.</p>

            <h3>Science: Understanding and Monitoring the Environment</h3>
            <p>Science forms the basis for understanding our environment. Through field studies, lab experiments, and real-time monitoring, scientists gather data on ecosystems, climate change, and human impact on nature. For example, satellite data helps track deforestation in the Amazon, showing land loss and its effects on oxygen levels and biodiversity. This research allows us to detect environmental issues and respond proactively.</p>

        <div class="stem-col">
            <h3>Technology: Tools for Sustainable Solutions</h3>
            <p>Technology is essential for a sustainable future. Innovations like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicles reduce reliance on fossil fuels and emissions. AI also aids environmental protection by analyzing data to monitor changes, such as detecting illegal logging in real-time through satellite images.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stem-col">
            <h3>Engineering: Building a Sustainable Future</h3>
            <p>Engineering creates practical solutions for sustainability. Engineers design energy-efficient buildings, resilient infrastructure, and systems that reduce waste, such as green roofs and eco-friendly transit. Innovations like desalination plants also help provide clean water in areas with limited freshwater resources.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="stem-col">
            <h3>Mathematics: The Language of Environmental Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                Mathematics enables us to model and predict environmental outcomes. Scientists use math to simulate climate scenarios, assess policy impacts, and optimize resources. For example, mathematical models help forecast temperature changes and their effects on sea levels and ecosystems, providing essential tools to address environmental challenges.</p>
